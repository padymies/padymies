# Hi, I'm Juan Antonio Padilla 👋

I'm a **full-stack software engineer** building web platforms and developer tooling that are meant to **last, scale, and evolve**.  
I work across frontend, backend, and AI-assisted workflows, including **Angular, React, Next.js, Node.js, Java**, and **MCP servers**.  

I enjoy solving complex problems, improving developer experience, and turning fragile systems into reliable platforms.  

*Good software is the result of consistent, thoughtful decisions.*
